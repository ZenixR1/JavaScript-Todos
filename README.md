This todo list was started from a project as part of the LetPhil community course on Javascript. At first it was very basic, no styling, just a nice and simple input field with a add button. You could select a done button to put a strikethrough. After that, they said to spiffy it up! Add some additional functionality and styling. This will be something that I had a week to complete. I will stop it's development on the dot and go from there.

This project's start in terms of git history was a good while after the start of styling and additional features have been added. Git was not initiated as i made this project folder in haste. Only to realize after being deeper into it. However you see it, it is past the point of a dark screen, being able to add notes from the bottom of the list, and with a checkbox to consider the task done. It should be a lot more fun!

Hope you enjoy!
