This todo list was started from a project as part of the LetPhil community course on Javascript. At first it was very basic, no styling, just a nice and simple input field with a add button. You could select a done button to put a strikethrough. After that, they said to spiffy it up! Add some additional functionality and styling.

Current Functionality:
    - Create a todo
    - Able to delete todo
    - Able to edit todo
    - Able to check the task as done
        - Currently does not delete upon completion.
    - Able to change the priority level on it
        - Currently starts on Medium priority.
    - Todos are saved and Deleted from localStorage so the content is saved until you delete or clear browser completely.

Upcoming Functionality:
    - Upon todo completion:
        - An alert sound will occur
        - An effect will happen as the todo disappears
        - It will be removed from the screen and localStorage
    - The ability to sort by priority level
    - The ability to set a priority level prior to todo has been "submitted"/added.
    - Drag and Drop to reorder the todos
        - This will also get saved with localStorage.

Hope you enjoy!
